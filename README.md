# Binary Classification to Determine the Subscription of Bank Product

Task

A banking institution ran a direct marketing campaign based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. This project is to predict whether someone will subscribe to the term deposit or not based on the given information.

The steps in the code:
1)  Data Cleaning
- This involves a first level look into the data and some standard pre-processing independent of the model to be used.

2)  Model Set1
- Test models apart from tree-based models, like SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Perform the necessary steps for all models:
	* feature engineer
	* model validation
	* feature selection 
	* model selection 

3)  Model Set2
- Test tree-based models, like decision tree, random forest, gradient boosted trees, etc.
- Perform the necessary steps for all models:
	* feature engineer
	* model validation
	* feature selection 
	* model selection 

4)  Model Ensemble
- Try model averaging and “poor man’s stacking” 

5)  Bonus: Resampling Techniques [up to 30 Extra Credit]
- Evaluate different resampling techniques and the “Easy Ensemble” technique.
